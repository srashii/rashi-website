            Hey, I am Rashi Srivastava, have almost 7 years of experience in
            Product space, I bring the expertise in building the products from
            scratch and guiding the same through 0 to 1 journey with a strong
            metric & experiment driven approach.
          </p>

            I actually started my career as a Business Analyst and got into
            product role accidentally, but after I got in I realised I love
            working on user problems. The happiness & excitement which you gain
            when you see that something you worked on is actually being used by
            people and itâ€™s actually solving a pain point they had, it just
            feels great, Plus I really enjoy kind of enjoy dealing and solving
            the chaos and complexity which every problem statement brings in.
            (Chaos is a ladder, these words by Littlefinger seem so true - for
            Game of Thrones fan only)
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            Right now I am in CoLearn, which is an edtech platform focused on
            Indonesian market, got promoted to Lead Product Manager 1 year back,
            as the Lead PM, I have owned the product strategy & development for
            the entire product where I played a pivotal role in orchestrating
            the expansion of live classes from 1000 to over 5000 paid
            subscribers within just six months. I am looking forward to gain
            more learning experiences and grow further in product.
